These data were derived by sampling the precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets to Watershed Boundary Dataset 
12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code Watersheds (http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html) using the Geo Data Portal (http://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/).

Precipitation and Evapotranspiration data were derived from the Daymet (http://daymet.ornl.gov/) and SSEBop (http://cida.usgs.gov/thredds/catalog.html?dataset=cida.usgs.gov/ssebopeta/monthly) datasets, respectively.

To access custom subsets of these and other data, visit the Geo Data Portal (http://cida.usgs.gov/gdp)

The single watershed file downloads contain data used to generate the plots on the web page. The multiple watershed 
file downloads contain individual local incremental Hydrologic Unit Code watershed data for the entire area upstream.
